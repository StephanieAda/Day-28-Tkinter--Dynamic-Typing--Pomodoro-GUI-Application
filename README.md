Creating a Pomodoro

Using more intensive/deeper knowledge of the tkinter module

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo.

It sets the timer for 25 mins 'Work Time' then a 5 mins 'Short Break'

This cycle is repeated 4 times then the short break is replaced with a 20 min 'Long Break'
